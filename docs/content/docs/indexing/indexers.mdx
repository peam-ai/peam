title: Indexers
description: Convert structured content into searchable artifacts
---

# Overview

Indexers take structured pages and produce searchable artifacts. In Peam, this is handled internally by the search engine implementation that the builder uses. Most users configure indexing through **withPeam** or the **CLI**, not by instantiating indexers directly.

## Responsibilities

- Normalize and chunk structured content.
- Attach metadata and identifiers.
- Produce index artifacts for storage.

## Example (CLI)

```bash
peam \
	--source fileBased --projectDir . --sourceDir dist \
	--store fileBased --indexPath .peam/index.json
```

## Notes

- The builder calls into the search engine for each structured page, then exports index data.
- Different search engine implementations can change how indexing behaves.
