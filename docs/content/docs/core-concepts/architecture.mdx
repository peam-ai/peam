description: High-level view of how Peam builder, indexers, and runtime services fit together
---

# Overview

Peam is organized around a build-time pipeline and a runtime query stack. The builder ingests your content through [index sources](/docs/indexing/sources), applies [filters](/docs/indexing/filters), and produces index artifacts that are written to [index stores](/docs/storage). At runtime, the search engine loads those artifacts to serve AI-powered answers to your client.

## What each part does

- **Index sources** discover pages or content to index. See [Index sources](/docs/indexing/sources).
- **Filters** prune or refine candidates before indexing. See [Filters](/docs/indexing/filters).
- **Peam Builder** orchestrates ingestion, normalization, and indexing.
- **Indexers** parse and structure content, producing embeddings, metadata, and search artifacts.
- **Index stores** persist index artifacts for runtime search. See [Storage](/docs/storage).
- **Search engine** loads stored artifacts and powers retrieval.
- **Runtime server** handles user queries, retrieval, and answer composition.
- **Client** renders [AskAI](/docs/components/ask-ai) surfaces and sends messages to the runtime API.

Next, see [Data flow](/docs/core-concepts/data-flow) to understand how a single query moves through the system.
