# POST

A ready-to-use HTTP handler exported from `peam/server`. It is equivalent to:

```ts
import { createChat } from 'peam/server';

export const POST = createChat().handler;
```

## Usage

```ts
export { POST } from 'peam/server';
```

## Notes

- Uses the default chat runtime configuration.
- Expects a POST request with the `ChatRequestBody` shape (`messages` and optional `summary`).
