description: Default Next.js route handler for Peam
---

# Overview

Exports a ready-to-use `POST` handler for Next.js route handlers. The handler uses the Next.js `createChat` wrapper and the configuration produced by `withPeam()`.

## Source

```ts
import { createChat } from './createChat';

export const POST = createChat().handler;
```

## Usage

```ts
export const maxDuration = 30;
export { POST } from '@peam-ai/next/route';
```

## Notes

- `withPeam()` must run during build so `getConfig()` can resolve the search store settings.
- The handler reads the search index via the configured `SearchIndexStore` injected by the Next.js `createChat` wrapper.
